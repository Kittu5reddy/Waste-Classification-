This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste into four categories: **Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable, Trash, or Hazardous**. The model is designed to assist in waste management by automating the classification process, making it easier to sort and recycle waste effectively.


### Resource:
- **Data-Set**:"kaggle datasets download -d alistairking/recyclable-and-household-waste-classification".

### Key Features:
- **Model Loading**: The model is loaded using a cached function to improve performance.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of waste through the Streamlit interface.
- **Prediction**: The uploaded image is processed and classified into one of the four categories using the trained CNN model.
- **User Feedback**: The app provides visual feedback by displaying the uploaded image and the predicted class.
